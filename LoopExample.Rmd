## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(car_loops)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

gtcars2 <- gtcars %>%
  dplyr::filter(ctry_origin == car_loop)


ggplot(gtcars2, aes(x = model, y = msrp, fill = msrp)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  theme_gray() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.y=element_blank())+
  ylab("Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) \n")+
  xlab("Cars Models") +
  labs(fill = "") +
  geom_text(aes(label = dollar(msrp)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), hjust = 1.1, angle = 90,
            color='white', size = 4) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
gt_table <- gtcars2 %>%
  dplyr::select(model, mpg_c, mpg_h, msrp) 


gt(gt_table) %>%
  fmt_currency(columns = vars(msrp), currency = "USD", decimals = 0) %>%
  cols_label(
    mpg_c = "MPG City",
    mpg_h = "MPG HWY",
    msrp = "MSRP")

```
